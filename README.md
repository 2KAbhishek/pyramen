<h3>Data Analysis for Ramen üçúüíπ</h3>

</div>

## What is this

PyRamen is a data analysis project that solves a very real problem for an imaginary ramen shop.

## Inspiration

Wanted to try out Azure notebooks, came across this dataset and boom!

### Imaginary problem statement

Welcome to 2KRamen!

Opening a ramen shop has always been my dream, and now it's finally been realized ‚Äì I'm closing out on my second year of sales!

I need to analyze my business's financial performance by cross-referencing my sales data with my internal menu data to figure out revenues and costs for the year.

I also want to analyze how well my business did on a per-product basis in order to better understand which products may need to be removed or changed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `python`

## Getting PyRamen

To get PyRamen, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/pyramen
cd pyramen
```

## Using PyRamen

```bash
python pyramen.py # This will run the program, and will produce a report

```

The report will be saved to the `gen/report.md` file. Try exploring the `data` and report folders to see what else you can do with the data.

## How it was built

pyramen was built using `python` and the `csv` module.

## Challenges faced

Hunting for the data, and coming up with an imaginative problem statement :)

## What I learned

- Didn't use pandas, opted for csv module, which was sufficient for this problem.
- Followed python best practices as much as possible.
